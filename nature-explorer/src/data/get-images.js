// This script would normally download images, but since we're building an offline app,
// we'll instead provide instructions on where to get images.

/*
To make the app work properly, you need to add plant images to the 'public/assets' folder with the following names:
1. neem.jpg
2. tulsi.jpg
3. banyan.jpg
4. marigold.jpg
5. mango.jpg
6. lotus.jpg
7. peepal.jpg
8. aloe.jpg
9. ashoka.jpg
10. jasmine.jpg

You can download royalty-free images of these plants from websites like:
- Unsplash (https://unsplash.com)
- Pexels (https://pexels.com)
- Pixabay (https://pixabay.com)

For testing purposes, you can use placeholder images from:
- https://picsum.photos/200 (replace 200 with your desired dimensions)

Remember to name your downloaded images according to the list above so they match the paths in the plants.json file.

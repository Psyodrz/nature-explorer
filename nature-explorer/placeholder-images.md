# Placeholder Images for Testing

You can use these URL placeholders for testing the app. Each URL generates a placeholder image.

1. **Neem**: https://picsum.photos/id/10/300/300 - Save as `public/assets/neem.jpg`
2. **Tulsi**: https://picsum.photos/id/11/300/300 - Save as `public/assets/tulsi.jpg`

5. **Mango**: https://picsum.photos/id/14/300/300 - Save as `public/assets/mango.jpg`
6. **Lotus**: https://picsum.photos/id/15/300/300 - Save as `public/assets/lotus.jpg`

## Steps to Add Images

1. Visit each URL above
2. Right-click on the image and select "Save Image As"
3. Save the image to the `public/assets` folder with the filename mentioned
4. Repeat for all 10 images

These images are for testing purposes only. For the actual app, you should replace them with relevant plant images.

Alternatively, for development, you can modify the image paths in `src/data/plants.json` to point directly to these URLs (remove the `/assets/` prefix and use the full URL). However, for a fully offline app, you should download the images locally.
